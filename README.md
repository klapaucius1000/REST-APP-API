# REST-App-api
<h1> PYTHON & DJANGO BACKEND REST API App  </h1>

<h3>Here is my backend API. It has been built on Python using Django, the Django REST Framework. The whole thing was written based on Docker using Postgres with Test Driven Development.</h3>

<h4>I am a bookworm myself and love to devour books. So I decided to create something like a registry of owned or read books in this version of the API.
</h4>

<h4>
<b>My API supports:</b><br>
-creating and updating a user profile<br>
-changing a password<br>
-Creating new objects and(books)<br>
-Creating tags assigned to objects<br>
-Creation of short reviews, reflections on created objects<br>
-Image transfer<br>
-Filtering and searching for objects<br>
-All of the above may also be removed<br>
</h4>

<h4>Used tech:<br>
Python 3.10<br>
Django 4<br>
Django REST Framework<br>
Docker<br>
Postgres 13-alpine<br>
Swagger UI 4.12.0<br>
psycopg2</h4>

<h4>Of course, this programme can be taken as a basis for further projects(This is also the plan). The design of the application is so modular that it can be quickly and painlessly extended with other modules, or used after changes in another capacity, e.g. as a container with recipes or your own thoughts.</h4>


<h4>What remains to be done?</h4>

<h5>
What remains is to upload the finished application to AWS(coming soon)<br>

and describe the process of installation and use(coming soon too)<br>
